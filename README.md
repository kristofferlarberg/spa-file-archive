# SPA File Archive
A code assignment to create a file archive with the framework of you choosing.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Method
My tactic for this assignment was to start with the things I know the least and go from there. Since I've only worked directly with backend a few times this became my main focus.

I first started following a tutorial for creating a [MERN application](https://github.com/kristofferlarberg/mern-stack) which would use MongoDB Atlas for storing data. The idea was to work from this and refactor etc according to the assignment, but after a while I had to choose another direction when it started taking too long and because there was trouble loading the datasets used in the turorial. Instead a started working on a SPA that would store files in JSON without a server.

The assignemnt was made during four hours and is very unfinished.
